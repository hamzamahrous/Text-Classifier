# Text Classification and Sorting Performance Analysis

This project loads a text file, filters out common English words, and classifies the text based on its most frequent words. It also compares the performance of different sorting algorithms in terms of time and memory usage.

## Features

- **Load and Filter Words:** Load words from a text file and convert them to lowercase.
- **Remove Common English Words:** Filter out common English words using a predefined list.
- **Count Word Frequency:** Count the frequency of each word in the filtered list.
- **Sort Words:** Use various sorting algorithms to sort the words and compare their performance:
  - Smart Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Classify Text:** Classify the text into one of the following topics based on the most frequent words:
  - Health
  - Technology
  - Travel and Tourism
  - Science
  - Art and Culture
  - Politics
  - Economy
- **Performance Table:** Generate a table summarizing the time and memory usage of the sorting algorithms.

## Usage

1. **Enter the file path:** The program prompts for the file path of the text file to classify.
2. **Load and filter words:** The words from the file are loaded and filtered.
3. **Count words and analyze performance:** The frequency of each word is counted, and the performance of different sorting algorithms is analyzed.
4. **Classify the text:** The text is classified based on the most frequent words.
5. **Display performance table:** A table summarizing the time and memory usage of the sorting algorithms is displayed.

## Example

```sh
Enter the file path to classify:
